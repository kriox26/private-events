<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1 class='text-info'>Welcome to the Events handler app!</h1>
  <p>
	Associations project, from TOP: You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's House").

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won't be able to just rely on Rails' defaults like you have before).

	<% if logged_in? %>
	  <%= link_to "Create an event!", new_event_path, class: "btn btn-lg btn-info"  %>
	<% else %>
	  <%= link_to "Sign up now!", signup_path, class: "btn btn-lg btn-info" %>
	<% end %>
</center>
